[KotlinConf 2017](https://kotlinconf.com) was abundant with great talks.
One of my favorites was **View State Machine for Network Calls on
Android** by [Amanda Hill](http://www.mandybess.com). If you haven't had
the opportunity, definitely check it out.

Amanda didn't have a repo with the code, so I decided to create my own.
_Be advised, I have not actually run the application on a device or emulator._
The fetching of the ice cream cone is faked and no image is set on
the view because API endpoints and icon assets just do not exist. This was
an exercise in patterns and testing as affected by multiple development
iterations.
